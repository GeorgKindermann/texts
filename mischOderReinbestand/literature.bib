  abstract     = {Mixed-species forests are promoted as a forest management strategy for climate change mitigation and adaptation because they are more productive and can be more resistant and resilient than monospecific forests under drought stress. However, the trait-based mechanisms driving these properties remain elusive, making it difficult to predict which functional identities of species best improve tree growth and decrease tree physiological water stress under drought. We investigated tree growth and physiological stress (i.e. increase in wood carbon isotopic ratio; δ13C) responses to changes in climate-induced water availability (wet-to-dry years) along gradients in neighbourhood tree species richness and drought-tolerance traits. Using tree cores from a large-scale biodiversity experiment, we tested the overarching hypothesis that neighbourhood species richness increases growth and decreases δ13C. We further hypothesized that the abiotic (i.e. climatic conditions) and the biotic context modulate these biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. We characterized the biotic context using drought-tolerance traits of focal trees and their neighbours. These traits are related to cavitation resistance vs. resource acquisition and stomatal control. We found that tree growth increased with neighbourhood species richness. However, we did not observe a universal relief of water stress in species-rich neighbourhoods, nor an increase in the strength of the relationship between richness and growth and between richness and δ13C from wet-to-dry years. Instead, these relationships depended on both the traits of the focal trees and their neighbours. At either end of each drought-tolerance gradient, species responded in opposing directions during drought and non-drought years. Synthesis: We report that the biotic context can determine the strength and nature of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in experimental tree communities. We derive two key conclusions: (1) drought-tolerance traits of focal trees and their neighbours can explain divergent tree responses to drought and diversity, and (2) contrasting, trait-driven responses of tree species to wet vs dry climatic conditions can promote forest community stability. Mixing tree species with a range of drought-tolerance traits may therefore increase forest productivity and stability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract  = {Throughfall deposition is an important pathway via which particles, aerosols and gases can move from the atmosphere to the forest floor, which can greatly impact forest biodiversity and functioning. Although throughfall deposition biochemistry has been well studied in forest ecosystems, less is known about how throughfall deposition is modified by tree species diversity. To disentangle the effects of tree species identity and diversity on throughfall deposition, we installed rain gauges in a 10-year-old tree diversity experiment. With these rain gauges, we monitored throughfall biweekly, and performed chemical analyses monthly for all the major ions (Na+, Cl−, SO42−-S, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, PO43−-P, NO3−-N and NH4+-N), for a period of one year. Based on these data, we analysed species identity (i.e. whether throughfall deposition depended on the tree species present in the overstorey), and diversity effects (i.e. whether throughfall deposition depended on tree species richness). We confirmed species identity effects on throughfall deposition. Presence of pine led to higher throughfall deposition of inorganic nitrogen, and lower amounts of phosphorus, calcium and magnesium reaching the forest floor. Additionally, species characteristics and stand structural characteristics, i.e. basal area and canopy cover, emerged as key factors driving throughfall deposition of sodium, chloride, nitrate, sulphate and potassium. Tree species diversity effects on throughfall deposition were also present, mostly via increased basal area and canopy cover, leading to increased throughfall deposition of inorganic nitrogen, sulphate, chloride, sodium and potassium. Our findings thus suggest that tree species diversity enhances throughfall deposition of most ions that we analysed, potentially increasing nutrient availability for below-canopy plant communities. Given that inorganic nitrogen and sulphur are major atmospheric pollutants, increased deposition in mixed plots might affect ecosystem functioning. Further research will be needed to determine the extent of this impact.},

abstract = {Abstract In recent decades, European temperate forests have repeatedly suffered from severe droughts. Drought-weakened forests have often become more susceptible to pest outbreaks such as bark beetle infestations. Tree species diversity is expected to increase resistance to drought and pests, but evidence for a positive tree diversity effect on insect pest reduction is largely circumstantial. Here we tested the effects of tree diversity and biogeographic origin of tree species on bark beetle infestation in a large, young tree diversity experiment, with six broadleaved and six conifer species from Europe and North America. Lower infestation risk was expected for the exotic tree species in each congeneric pair (spruce, larch and pine) and for mixtures with higher species richness and higher broadleaf proportion. Following a severe drought in summer 2018, the conifer trees were attacked by the six-toothed spruce bark beetle Pityogenes chalcographus. Bark beetle boreholes were recorded in winter 2018/2019 on all conifer species. Norway spruce Picea abies and European larch Larix decidua were the most infested species and thus considered main hosts of the bark beetle. For these two species, probability of infestation decreased with increasing tree diversity (although this was only significant for Larix). In contrast, Pinus, which were less infested overall, were more likely to be infested in plots with high tree diversity. Exotic trees tended to be less infested, with clearest support for enemy release found at the level of infestation intensity when considering pure conifer stands. Overall, the effects of tree diversity and tree species origin were not as strong as the effect of position within the experimental site, where higher rates of infestation were observed at the edge than in the centre. Synthesis. Increasing tree diversity may reduce the risk of bark beetle infestation for genera prone to high infestation rates (Picea and Larix), but risk for less preferred genera (Pinus, and to some extent the exotic tree species) may increase with tree diversity due to spillover from preferred hosts. In mixed forests, the risk of infestation, even by relatively specialized insect pests, may be redistributed among tree species rather than reduced for all.},

  abstract  = {Nearly all forest plantations are established as monocultures, but research has shown that there are potential advantages to be gained by using carefully designed species mixtures in place of monocultures. This paper reviews recent studies that compare stand development and productivity of mixed and pure plantations. Higher stand-level productivity in mixtures has been found with two kinds of species interactions: (1) complementary resource use between species that arises from development of a stratified canopy (and possibly root stratification); (2) facilitative improvement in nutrition of a valuable timber species growing in mixture with a nitrogen-fixing species (but only if combined with complementary resource use as well). These mixtures can also improve economic return through greater individual-tree growth rates and provision of multiple commercial or subsistence products. More complex plantation mixtures of 5–70 species have been used for ecological restoration of degraded lands; these large numbers of species of different successional stages are combined to reduce the need for a series of sequential plantings. Future research needs to examine many more tree species across a wider range of sites. Innovative planting designs have been developed to reduce the land area needed for mixed-species plantation experiments, by focusing on individual-tree analysis rather than plot-level analysis.},

Investigations were carried out at a trial using the replacement series design, which consisted of the following combinations: 100\% eucalypts (100\%E), 75\% eucalypts + 25\% acacia (75\%E:25\%A), 50\% eucalypts + 50\% acacia (50\%E:50\%A), 25\% eucalypts + 75\% acacia (25\%E:75\%A), and 100\% acacia (100\%A). At 9.5 years, stem volume and biomass were highest in 50\%E:50\%A treatments. Canopy stratification occurred in all mixtures, with acacias in the lower and eucalypts in the upper canopy stratum. This and the increasing canopy light interception with increasing proportion of acacia in the mixture indicated that A. mearnsii is substantially more shade tolerant than E. globulus. Midcanopy foliage of E. globulus in the 50\%E:50\%A mixture had higher foliage nitrogen (N) but lower phosphorus (P) concentrations and lower light-saturated net photosynthesis rates (Amax) than those in the 100\%E treatment. In addition, similar relationships between eucalypt crown volume and stem biomass across treatments indicated that eucalypt crowns were not more efficient in mixture. Our study indicates that the productivity gains in these mixtures may be partially attributable to aboveground niche separation between species. }

abstract = {Due to possible positive and compensatory interaction between species, mixed stands are a commonly accepted silvicultural response to reduce risks arising from climate change. Nonetheless, only a few species combinations have been studied more detailed so far revealing variable mixing effects. Here, we analyze the effect of the mixture of Douglas fir and European beech with regard to the species-specific climate sensitivity of growth. We focus on three hypotheses: (i) Species-specific long term growing performance and climate sensitivity do not differ between monocultures and mixed stands, (ii) species-specific growth reactions to severe drought events do not differ between monocultures and mixed species stands and (iii) species-specific growth reactions on severe drought events are not influenced by differing ecological growing conditions. To scrutinize the hypothesis we analyzed tree cores from both species taken from pure and mixed stands covering different site conditions and age classes. Tree ring characteristics were used to analyze the differences in climate related long-term growth responses in pure and mixed stands. Short-term responses were investigated by growth reaction indices on individual tree and stand level involving drought events during the years 1950–2010. Linear mixed models were applied to detect effects of ecological co-variables on the indices. Results reveal that Douglas-fir in mixed stands exhibit a significant improved growing performance compared to pure stands. European beech seems to react indifferently concerning its performance in mixture compared to pure stands. Differences in drought stress resistance and growth recovery time mainly arose between the species. Douglas-fir showed a significantly lower resistance and required more time to reach again its initial growth level compared to European beech. In mixture we found a trend that Douglas-fir growth recovery time is shortened and extended for European beech. The analysis along the ecological gradients showed that base-limited soils systems are more drought-tolerant during drought events. Lower basal area as a proxy for reduced stand competition decreased the relative growth loss by drought. We hypothesize that mainly spatial differentiation in height trigger enhanced diameter growth of Douglas-fir in mixture. Temporal differentiation expressed by deferred phenology attenuates climate sensitivity of this conifer. We conclude that in mixed Douglas-fir and European beech stands the former species is stabilized against climatic impacts. On the contrary, climate sensitivity of European beech is increased.}

abstract = {Automated time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements in high resolution over soil depth and over time were performed in a mixed beech-spruce and a spruce stand during two hydrologically contrasting seasons. Soil drying was more intensive and reached deeper soil layers in the mixed stand, which on the other hand allowed more stand precipitation, compensating for the higher evapotranspiration rates. These results were confirmed by a large number of spatially distributed TDR measurements along grids of different spacing, which additionally covered a beech stand. Spatial water depletion patterns of the topsoil in spring appeared to be largely congruent with tree species distribution and reflected the higher water consumption of fully foliated beech. Variability was highest in the mixed stand, where a spatial correlation within a range of about 7 m was observed. The pure stands lacked spatial correlation. The effect of the mixed stand on soil water depletion and recharge turned out to be non-additive as compared to the pure stands of beech and spruce: changes of soil water storage under the mixed stand almost equalled the values measured in the beech stand. During selected drying periods in 2000 average daily water extraction rates from the uppermost 60 cm of soil amounted to 1.65 mm in the beech as well as in the mixed stand, which is about 45\,\% more than under pure spruce. Maximum differences of up to 84\,\% occurred in periods with high evaporative demand. The over-proportionate evapotranspiration of the mixed stand was exclusively attributable to beech, which deepened and intensified its fine-root system in mixture, while spruce rooted more shallowly. The mixed stand extracted a higher percentage of water from deeper soil layers than the pure stands.}

abstract = {Forest trees exhibit a large variation in basal area increment, which depends on tree specific factors, inter-tree relations and the environment. Studying the effect of the above factors on tree growth is essential for forest ecology and forest management. In this study, a basal area increment model for 22 tree species of the Austrian National Forest Inventory was parameterized. The model included effects of tree size, competition, harvesting and disturbances, climate, soil, and species mixtures. The models were fitted using generalized additive models. Basal area increment increased with tree size for all species, and competition and density reduced tree growth. Shade-tolerant tree species showed a more pronounced decrease with competition, than light-demanding tree species. Tree growth increased with disturbance intensity, but confidence intervals for high disturbance intensities became larger. Many variants of the model that included climatic effects were tested, but the best variants used long-term-mean temperature and precipitation during the growing season and the positive and negative deviations thereof, which separated climatic site effects from temperature deviations due to yearly weather conditions. Several of the tested dryness indices were not able to explain tree growth from inventory data. Soil type and soil moisture were significant for many tree species, each of them accounting for a maximum of 10\% of difference in tree growth. Little growth was observed on calcareous Leptosols, whereas trees grew best on Planosols, on flysch or calcareous Cambisols. Growth was decreased on dry sites, but very moist and wet sites could result in either a decrease or an increase in growth, depending on the tree species. Mixture effects were significant for almost all mixtures with a sufficient number of observations in the data set. Notable exceptions were the mixtures of Pinus sylvestris L. with Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Abies alba Mill. and the mixtures of Quercus spp. with Pinus sylvestris L. and Fagus sylvatica L.. Mixture effects were both favorable and adverse at individual tree level. Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica were two tree species, which were mainly favored by mixture effects. Interactions of mixture with age or site could not be modelled from the data because they were confounded with other effects of the inventory data. The new basal area increment model provided a comprehensive formulation, which can be use part of individual tree growth simulators and is easily transferable to other regions and environments and can be extended in the future.}

There is, however, little empirical evidence to support this assumption. We investigated for the first time how differently grained forest management systems affect the biodiversity of multiple above- and below-ground taxa across spatial scales. We sampled 15 taxa of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria within the largest contiguous beech forest landscape of Germany and classified them into functional groups. Selected forest stands have been managed for more than a century at different spatial grains. The EA (coarse-grained management) and UEA (fine-grained) forests are comparable in spatial arrangement, climate and soil conditions. These were compared to forests of a nearby national park that have been unmanaged for at least 20 years. We used diversity accumulation curves to compare γ-diversity for Hill numbers 0D (species richness), 1D (Shannon diversity) and 2D (Simpson diversity) between the management systems. Beta diversity was quantified as multiple-site dissimilarity. Gamma diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for at least one of the three Hill numbers for six taxa (up to 77\%), while eight showed no difference. Only bacteria showed the opposite pattern. Higher γ-diversity in EA forests was also found for forest specialists and saproxylic beetles. Between-stand β-diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for one-third (all species) and half (forest specialists) of all taxa, driven by environmental heterogeneity between age-classes, while α-diversity showed no directional response across taxa or for forest specialists. Synthesis and applications. Comparing EA and uneven-aged forest management in Central European beech forests, our results show that a mosaic of different age-classes is more important for regional biodiversity than high within-stand heterogeneity. We suggest reconsidering the current trend of replacing even-aged management in temperate forests. Instead, the variability of stages and stand structures should be increased to promote landscape-scale biodiversity.},

  abstract       = {Tree species diversity can positively affect the multifunctionality of forests. This is why conifer monocultures of Scots pine and Norway spruce, widely promoted in Central Europe since the 18th and 19th century, are currently converted into mixed stands with naturally dominant European beech. Biodiversity is expected to benefit from these mixtures compared to pure conifer stands due to increased abiotic and biotic resource heterogeneity. Evidence for this assumption is, however, largely lacking. Here, we investigated the diversity of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens at the plot (alpha diversity) and at the landscape (gamma diversity) level in pure and mixed stands of European beech and conifer species (Scots pine, Norway spruce, Douglas fir) in four regions in Germany. We aimed to identify compositions of pure and mixed stands in a hypothetical forest landscape that can optimize gamma diversity of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens within regions. Results show that gamma diversity of the investigated groups is highest when a landscape comprises different pure stands rather than tree species mixtures at the stand scale. Species mainly associated with conifers rely on light regimes that are only provided in pure conifer forests, whereas mixtures of beech and conifers are more similar to beech stands. Combining pure beech and pure conifer stands at the landscape scale can increase landscape level biodiversity and conserve species assemblages of both stand types, while landscapes solely composed of stand scale tree species mixtures could lead to a biodiversity reduction of a combination of investigated groups of 7 up to 20%.},

ABSTRACT = {An increasing number of investigations into mixed forest stands shows clear interactions between complementarity and stand and site characteristics. One of the least-investigated mixture types are mixed stands of Norway spruce and European larch. We investigated pure and mixed stands of these species in the northern part of the eastern intermediate Alps in Austria, at altitudes between approximately 880 and 1330 m above sea level. In these stands, 12 plots sized between 0.25 ha and 1.6 ha, with varying ages and proportions of Norway spruce, were established. All trees were measured for their coordinates, diameter at breast height, tree height, crown height, and crown projection area. The trees were cored at breast height, and from about 200 felled sample trees, equations for leaf area and for the five-year volume increment were developed. Growth efficiency (volume increment of a species per its fraction of the stand area) exhibited a clear interaction with age: in young mixed stands, spruce as well as larch grew less than the reference from the pure stands, while in the older stands especially spruce grew much better in the mixed stands. When the Clark Evans index was entered into the growth efficiency equations, it could be seen that the spatial distribution of the trees (i) explained more variance than the species proportion and (ii) showed an additional influence of stand density on the complementarity of the species.},
